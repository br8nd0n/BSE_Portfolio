# Brandon - Fingerprint ID Safe
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Third Milestone
My third milestone was completing the safe and connecting all of the components together. I encountered some issues when my code would not compare two variables due to their differing types, but I was ultimately able to resolve the issue. Furthermore, I was able to reprogram the keypad to check for different password lengths rather than a predetermined amount, increasing the security of the device. I also drilled holes into the side of the safe to put the wires through and installed an impromptu switch to turn the device on and off. In the future, I plan to include a speaker to hide the sound of the servo turning, secure the locking mechanism, and hide the wiring to make the safe look better overall.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was connecting the keypad, fingerprint sensor, and servo together. Though I encountered some issues with the motor twitching, I ultimately decided to ignore it since the locking mechanism would be unlikely to completely fail due to small movements of the motor. The safe will now open and close with either a fingerprint or a passcode. In addition, the safe still needs a way to be turned off, whether that be through the use of two wires or with a switch. Finally, I still need to determine how I will mount the locking system into the safe as well as figure out how to install both the fingerprint sensor and the keypad on the safe front, but once those two issues are resolved there will likely be no further issues hindering the safe's completion.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting the fingerprint sensor to register and recognize fingerprints. Currently, the fingerprint sensor is hooked up to two LEDs, one of which will turn on depending on if the fingerprint is recognized or not. However, I had some trouble deciphering the sample code that made the fingerprint sensor work so that I could include my own code within it to have the arduino turn on the lights. I also had to solve the issue of whether I should include a way to recode the fingerprint sensor to accept different fingerprints, but I ultimately decided against doing so. The entire setup works smoothly, but I still need to build a switch into the system to be able to turn off the sensor at will. Furthermore, I plan to recode the arduino to cause the safe to open instead of simply turning on LEDs. Once the safe arrives, I will begin working on the safe itself and hook it up to a keypad as well as the fingerprint sensor.
